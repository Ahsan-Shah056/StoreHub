## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ahsan-Shah056/Storecore.git
cd Storecore

# 2. Set up a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Set up the MySQL database
- Use storecore.sql to create all tables and relationships:
- mysql -u <username> -p < storecore.sql
- Edit database.py with your MySQL credentials

# 4. (Optional) Populate with sample data
python sample_data.py

# 5. Run the application
python main.py
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How the App Operates

### For Sales Staff

- **Start the Application:** Launch `main.py`.
- **Add to Cart:** Enter SKU and quantity, click 'Add to Cart'.
- **Select Customer:** Use the dropdown to select a customer.
- **Checkout:** Click 'Checkout' to complete the sale and view the receipt.
- **Error Handling:** Any invalid input or DB error is shown in a popup, and the operation is safely rolled back.

### For Managers/Admins

- **Inventory:** Add/delete products, adjust stock, and view inventory value.
- **Customers/Suppliers:** Add, delete, and view all records. Supplier and customer dropdowns are always up-to-date.
- **Reports:**
  - Use the Reports tab to generate business insights (low stock, sales by employee, inventory value, customer purchase history, etc.).
  - Use dropdowns to filter by employee, supplier, or customer as needed.
  - All reports are generated via optimized SQL queries for performance.

### For Developers

- **Codebase Structure:**
  - Each business domain (sales, inventory, etc.) is encapsulated in its own Python module.
  - UI logic is separated from business logic and data access.
  - All DB access uses parameterized queries and context management.
- **Adding New Features:**
  - To add a new report, create a function in `reporting.py`, add a callback in `main.py`, and wire a button/dropdown in `Ui.py`.
  - To extend the UI, subclass or modify the relevant UI class in `Ui.py`.
- **Testing & Debugging:**
- **Testing & Debugging:**
  - All exceptions are caught and surfaced to the user.
  - Use print statements or logging for deeper debugging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Use `storecore.sql` to set up your MySQL database schema. This file contains all necessary CREATE TABLE and relationship statements for Storecore.
- Edit `database.py` to set your MySQL username, password, and database name (`store`).
- Ensure MySQL server is running before launching the app.
- All DB credentials are kept in code for simplicity; for production, use environment variables or a config file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
- MySQL Server (with InnoDB for transactions)
- (Optional) MySQL Workbench for DB management

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example: Adding a New Report (Developer Guide)

```python
# In reporting.py
def top_selling_products(cursor):
    query = """
        SELECT SKU, name, SUM(quantity) as total_sold
        FROM SaleItems
        JOIN Products USING(SKU)
        GROUP BY SKU, name
        ORDER BY total_sold DESC
        LIMIT 10;
    """
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()

# In main.py
def top_selling_products_callback():
    data = reporting.top_selling_products(cursor)
    columns = ("SKU", "Product Name", "Total Sold")
    rows = [(d['SKU'], d['name'], d['total_sold']) for d in data]
    pos_app.reports_ui.display_report(columns, rows)

# In Ui.py
# Add a button in ReportsUI and wire it to the callback
```
